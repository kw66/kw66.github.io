Original prompt: Implement option 3 with a simple 6x4 mascot linkup game.

- Added plan to implement three homepage nav states: home, slot, and linkup.
- Added a new `?view=linkup` path target via query param routing.
- Implemented a simple 6x4 mascot linkup board with classic <=2-turn connectivity rules.
- Added a post-clear research-fortune result for the linkup page.
- Preserved the fixed desktop-scale layout and the existing homepage content sections.
- Kept the masthead static to avoid greedy-nav collapsing the custom buttons.
- Pending: push changes, run Playwright against the deployed page, and fix any interaction/layout regressions found there.
